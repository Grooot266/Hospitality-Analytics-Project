# Hospitality-Analytics-Project

• Designed a Power BI dashboard that improved business decision-making by tracking weekly changes in revenue, occupancy, and
RevPAR for hospitality clients.

• Implemented DAX measures to calculate WoW percentage changes using dynamic date filtering and context-aware calculations
for current and previous week comparisons.

• Applied DAX functions like CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, and DIVIDE to create reusable and optimized formulas for visualizing
performance trends

Some Important features which are implemented and highlighted through this dashboard :-
